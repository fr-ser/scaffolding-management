# Scaffolding Management

This app should provide basic functionalities to manage a very specific scaffolding business.
The functionality basically includes:

- client management
- invoice management

## Development

For most development tasks the `Makefile` can be used. You can run `make` to see the available commands.

### Requirements

The following tools are required to use the development setup

- bash like terminal (Windows is not supported as a development environment - try using WSL if you must use Windows)
- make
- nodejs (use a version manager like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) or manually conform to the version in `.tool-versions`)
- npm
